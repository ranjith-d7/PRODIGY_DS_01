Problem Statement
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. The dataset is from the World Bank and contains information about the total population of various countries and regions over several years from 1960 to 2022. The metadata dataset contains the Country names and the Income distribution with respect to the Regions.

Data Description
The "Population, total" data used here is primarily sourced from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects: 2022 Revision. The data represents the estimated de facto mid-year population for various countries or regions. The data includes the total population, regardless of legal status or citizenship (citizens, permanent residents, temporary residents, undocumented immigrants).
